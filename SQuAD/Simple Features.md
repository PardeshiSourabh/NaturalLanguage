We can see that the SQuAD dataset is structured and close-domained i.e. it only contains selected question answer pairs.
Context is the paragraph from the article within which the answer is located. This text is under the key 'paragraphs'. Every Context contains a set of questions and their respective answers that are placed under the key 'answers'. The dataset also provides the index of the character where the answer to the question starts. Let's go ahead and convert this information into an excel sheet for better and easier data handling.


```python
X.iloc[6,0]['paragraphs'][56]
```




    {'context': 'P. Christiaan Klieger, an anthropologist and scholar of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, writes that the vice royalty of the Sakya regime installed by the Mongols established a patron and priest relationship between Tibetans and Mongol converts to Tibetan Buddhism. According to him, the Tibetan lamas and Mongol khans upheld a "mutual role of religious prelate and secular patron," respectively. He adds that "Although agreements were made between Tibetan leaders and Mongol khans, Ming and Qing emperors, it was the Republic of China and its Communist successors that assumed the former imperial tributaries and subject states as integral parts of the Chinese nation-state."',
     'qas': [{'answers': [{'answer_start': 304,
         'text': 'the Tibetan lamas and Mongol khans'}],

```python
contexts = []
questions = []
answer_texts = []
starts_at = []
```


```python
for data in range(X.shape[0]):
    title = X.iloc[data,0]['paragraphs']
    for subtitle in title:
        for qa in subtitle['qas']:
            questions.append(qa['question'])
            starts_at.append(qa['answers'][0]['answer_start'])
            answer_texts.append(qa['answers'][0]['text'])
            contexts.append(subtitle['context'])
```

Create a single Dataframe with all data


```python
df = pd.DataFrame({"context":contexts, "question": questions, "answer_start": starts_at, "text": answer_texts})
```


```python
df.to_csv("data/train.csv", index = None)
```


```python
df.shape
```




    (87599, 4)




## Using InferSent for creating embeddings and dumping data dictionary to pickle


```python
uniquecontext = list(df['context'].drop_duplicates().reset_index(drop= True))
```


```python
from textblob import TextBlob

tb = TextBlob(" ".join(uniquecontext))
sentences = [item.raw for item in tb.sentences]
```

#### Transfer Learning:  Import InferSent LSTM model with pretrained GloVe vectors for creating sentence embeddings


```python
import sys
sys.path.append('InferSent')
import torch

from models import InferSent
model_version = 1
MODEL_PATH = "InferSent/encoder/infersent%s.pkl" % model_version
params_model = {'bsize': 64, 'word_emb_dim': 300, 'enc_lstm_dim': 2048,
                'pool_type': 'max', 'dpout_model': 0.0, 'version': model_version}
model = InferSent(params_model)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(MODEL_PATH))
use_cuda = True
model = model.cuda()
```


```python
model.set_w2v_path("InferSent/glove/glove.840B.300d.txt")
```


```python
model.build_vocab(sentences, tokenize=True)
```

    Found 88993(/109718) words with w2v vectors
    Vocab size : 88993
    

This Step is just for visualization purposes. If you don't have a GPU, this step will take a lot of time. Just load the pre created embeddings from embedding1.pkl and embedding2.pkl as specified below


```python
with open("data/embedding1.pickle", "rb") as f:
    d1 = pickle.load(f)

with open("data/embedding2.pickle", "rb") as f:
    d2 = pickle.load(f)
```


```python
dict_embeddings = {}
for i in range(len(sentences)):
    dict_embeddings[sentences[i]] = model.encode([sentences[i]], tokenize=True)
```


```python
questions = list(df["question"])
```


```python
len(questions)
```




    87599




```python
for i in range(len(questions)):
    dict_embeddings[questions[i]] = model.encode([questions[i]], tokenize=True)
```


```python
d1 = {key:dict_embeddings[key] for i, key in enumerate(dict_embeddings) if i % 2 == 0}
d2 = {key:dict_embeddings[key] for i, key in enumerate(dict_embeddings) if i % 2 == 1}
```


```python
import pickle

with open('data/embedding1.pickle', 'wb') as handle:
    pickle.dump(d1, handle)
with open('data/embedding2.pickle', 'wb') as handle:
    pickle.dump(d2, handle)
```


```python
X_train = pd.read_csv('data/train.csv')
```


```python
X_train
```
